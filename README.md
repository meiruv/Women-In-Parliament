# Women-In-Parliament
 In this project, I dug in a dataset from UN Data which listed the amount (in percentage) of parliament seats taken by women per each country in the world during the years 1990,2000,2005,2010 and 20015-2019 and in each continent during the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015-2019. The main goals were to enhance my EDA and visualization skills and get some experience using matplotlib and seaborn, as well as learn where the world stands regarding women's representation in parliament.
Do note - I ran everything on Google Colab.

I wrote a blog post about this analysis that can be found here : https://medium.com/@meirav58/women-in-parliament-worldwide-in-the-past-30-years-data-driven-analysis-272dbc88f6f7
